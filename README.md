The goal of this project is to create an app geared towards the employment and connection of artists and musicians. The tentative name will be Bandly. The idea is that a musician/artist can make a profile that acts as a advertisement for their skills and music, they are then capable of joining a band which will be a group of musicians. There will also be venues, which will be able to advertise their callendars in order to recruit bands. For artists there will be a similar relationship but the venue could also instead be a studio or single persojn looking for a comission.

FOR PARTS 3, 4 and 5 VIDEOS PLEASE LOOK AT THE LINKS FILE part3_and_part4_links.txt. Github destroyed my videos on upload for some reason and I wasn't aware until I got my grade back.

TO RUN: "java bandly" inside of the Proj folder, it's a bit large since I included actual songs in the demo, although the recording software does not play them on my live demo.
