# OOD
The goal of this project is to create an app geared towards the employment and connection of artists and musicians. The tentative name will be Bandly. The idea is that a musician/artist can make a profile that acts as a advertisement for their skills and music, they are then capable of joining a band which will be a group of musicians. There will also be venues, which will be able to advertise their callendars in order to recruit bands. For artists there will be a similar relationship but the venue could also instead be a studio or single persojn looking for a comission.
